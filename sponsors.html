    <h1>How Your Donations Help</h1>

    <p>
      Your generous contributions are making a real difference. With your
      support, I can continue to learn and grow as a developer, accessing
      essential coding courses and resources that expand my knowledge. Each
      donation helps cover the costs of courses, tools, and even the much-needed
      coffee that fuels late-night coding sessions. But your impact goes beyond
      just my personal development. With your help, I plan to invest in user
      studies and further research, allowing me to understand better the needs
      of people with dyslexia. This will enable me to refine and enhance "Easy
      Read," ensuring it truly makes reading easier and more enjoyable for
      everyone who uses it.

    <p>
      I want to extend my heartfelt thanks for your generosity. Your support is
      not just a financial contributionâ€”it's an investment in a brighter, more
      inclusive future for everyone who struggles with reading. With your help,
      I'm gaining the skills and knowledge to improve "Easy Read" and bring it
      to more people who need it. Thank you for believing in this project and in
      me. Together, we're making a difference!
