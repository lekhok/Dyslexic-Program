  <h1>Bionic Reading</h1>

  <p>Bionic Reading is a web application that utilizes bolding of random characters in each word to make reading easier for dyslexic people. This program takes each word from a given sentence and bolds a random number of characters from the start of each word, ensuring that the bolded characters do not exceed half the length of the word.</p>

  <h2>How to use</h2>

  <p>To use Bionic Reading, simply open the <code>index.html</code> file in your web browser and enter the sentence you want to read in the input box. The output will be displayed in a separate textbox with the bolded characters.</p>
